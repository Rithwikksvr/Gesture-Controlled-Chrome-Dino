# Motion-Controlled-Google-Chrome-Offline-Dinosaur-using-Python-and-OpenCV

I made this project for fun. After learning OpenCV Python I thoguth making a fun interesting Project out of it. Here we can control Google Chrome Offline Dinosaur game using OpenCV. It processes the image and sends the signal to jump or not.

Currently I am working on applying Reinforment Learning so that it can learn by itself how to cross the obstacles by itself without intervention of external agents.

In a few days I will be releasing the Environment for the Game. So everyone out there can use this environment to train their Agents.

Have Fun!!
